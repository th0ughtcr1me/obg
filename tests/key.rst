Key to The Wheel: Samsara?

Have you ever died, I mean, really died and seen your whole life go
through as a memory and the apparent non-limited relativity of
flipping meaning in the natural sense or bits in the code that appears
to digitally effect in the non-digital, base layer of reality as an
instance of itself at every moment of increasing thermodynamic energy
whether, of course such meta-dynamic aspect of itself is not but
non-pseudo-random. How far can a day go into nature to have any number
of its elements or its sets elements to inspect their own sense of
existence.
